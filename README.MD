No|Pin|Description
:--:|:--:|-----------
1|M0*|Work with M1 to set 1 of 4 operating modes.
2|M1*|Work with M0 to set 1 of 4 operating modes.

4|TXD*|TTL UART output. Can be configured as open-drain or push-pull output.
5|AUX*|Indicates module’s working status. Can be configured as open-drain output orpush-pull output (floating is allowed).
6|VCC|Power supply 2.3-5.2V DC
7|GND|Ground.

__(*) All communication pins are 3.3V only !!!__

### Operating modes

No|Mode|M1|M0|Description
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|-----------
0|Normal|0|0|UART and LoRa radio are on.
1|Wake Up|0|1|Same as normal but preamble code is added to transmitted data to wake up the receiver.
2|Power Save|1|0|UART is off, LoRa radio is on WOR(wake on radio) mode which means the device will turn on when there is data to be received. Transmission is not allowed.
3|Sleep|1|1|UART is on, LoRa radio is off. Is used to get/set module parameters or to reset the module.

### Module frequency

For the E32-868T20D, the minimum frequency is 862 MHz and the maximum is 893 MHz. The working frequency of the module is set by the __channel number__. The formula is :
* __Module frequency = Minimum frequency + channel_number * 1 MHz__
The default channel number for the E32-868T20D module is 6, so the working frequency defaults to 862 MHz + 6*1 MHz = 868 MHz

### Transmission modes

![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_transmodes.jpg) 

1. __Transparent transmission__\
All modules have the same address and channel and can send/receive messages to/from each other (demo mode). The messages don't include address and channel information.

1. __Fixed transmission__\
All modules can have different addresses and channels. The transmission messages are prefixed with the destination address and channel information. If these differ from the settings of the transmitter, then the configuration of the module will be changed before the transmission. After the transmission is complete, the transmitter will revert to its prior configuration.

    - __Fixed transmission P2P__\
    The transmitted message has the address and channel information of the receiver. Only this module will receive the message. This is a point to point transmission between 2 modules.\
    ![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_fixed_P2P.jpg)

    - __Fixed transmission broadcast__\
    The transmitted message has address FFFF and a channel.  All modules with any address and the same channel of the message will receive it.\
    ![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_fixed_Broadcast.jpg)

    - __Fixed transmission monitoring__\
    The receiver has adress FFFF and a channel. It will receive messages from all modules with any address and the same channel as the receiver.


### Module configuration

The module can only be configured when in __sleep operating mode__ (M0 high & M1 high). __The UART baudrate has to be 9600 and parity 8N1.__

### Communication pins signal analysis

To make sense of the different communication pins of the E32 LoRa module, a simple [USB logic analyzer](https://www.banggood.com/USB-Logic-Analyzer-24M-8CH-Microcontroller-ARM-FPGA-Debug-Tool-p-1177821.html?rmmds=buy&cur_warehouse=CN) and an [opensource software](https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView) comes to the rescue :)\
I looked at these scenario's :

1. __Transparent transmission__\
The device is in normal mode (M0 and M1 both low). Some time after the message data is received on the RXD pin of the module, the AUX pin goes low. The AUX pin stays low until all data has been transmitted by the LoRa radio, after which it goes high again.
![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_transmit_transparent.jpg)

1. __Fixed transmission in normal mode__\
The device is in normal mode (M0 and M1 both low). Some time after the message data is received on the RXD pin of the module, the AUX pin goes low. The message is prefixed with the address and channel info. The AUX pin stays low until all data has been transmitted by the LoRa radio, after which it goes high again.
![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_transmit_normal.jpg)

1. __Fixed transmission in wakeup mode__\
The device is in wakeup mode (M0 high, M1 low). Some time after the message data is received on the RXD pin of the module, the AUX pin goes low. The message is prefixed with the preamble wakeup signal, the address and channel info. The AUX pin stays low until all data has been transmitted by the LoRa radio, after which it goes high again.
![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_transmit_wakeup.jpg)

1. __Receiving__\
The device is in normal mode (M0 and M1 both low). When the LoRa radio receives a signal, the AUX pin goes low. The AUX pin stays low until all data has been sent to the TXD pin, after which it goes high again.
![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_receive.jpg)

1. __Command set config with persistent save__\
The device is in sleep mode (both M0 and M1 high). Some time after the set config command is received on the RXD pin of the module, the AUX pin goes low. After the config response is sent to the TXD pin, the AUX pin goes high. 
![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_setconfig_save.jpg)

1. __Command set config with temporary save__\
The device is in sleep mode (both M0 and M1 high). Some time after the set config command is received on the RXD pin of the module, the AUX pin goes low. After the config response is sent to the TXD pin, the AUX pin goes high.
![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_setconfig_nosave.jpg)

1. __Command get config__\
The device is in sleep mode (both M0 and M1 high). Some time after the get config command is received on the RXD pin of the module, the AUX pin goes low. After the config response is sent to the TXD pin, the AUX pin goes high. 
![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_getconfig.jpg)

1. __Command get version__\
The device is in sleep mode (both M0 and M1 high). Some time after the get version command is received on the RXD pin of the module, the AUX pin goes low. After the version response is sent to the TXD pin, the AUX pin goes high. 
![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_getversion.jpg)

1. __Command reset device__\
The device is in sleep mode (both M0 and M1 high). Some time after the reset command is received on the RXD pin of the module, the AUX pin goes low and stays low while the device is resetting. After the module is ready again, the AUX pin goes high.\

## Test setup with ESP32

![E32-868T20D](images/E32868T20D_test_setup.jpg)


E32 Pin|Wire|ESP32 pin
:-----:|:--:|:-------:
M0|cyan|GPIO25
M1|cyan|GPIO26
RXD|yellow|SD3 (UART1-TXD)
TXD|green|SD2 (UART1-RXD)
AUX|purple|GPIO27
VCC|red|3.3V
GND|black|GND


* Because both the ESP32 and the E32 LoRa module are 3.3V compliant, no voltage dividers are necessary for communication.
* To stabilize the power supply for the E32 LoRa module, an electrolytic capacitor of 100 µF is placed on the power rail of the breadboard.

## Proof of Concept

To validate the proper working of the ebyteE32 micropython/circuitpython class this simple sensor measuring scenario has been implemented :
1. __Sensor nodes__ 
    - each sensor node contains an ESP32 microcontroller, an Ebyte E32 LoRa module, a sensor and a 3.3V power supply with integrated 18650 Li-ion battery.
    - the node wakes up every 5 minutes, takes a sensor reading and transmits it with the E32 LoRa module. Then it goes to deepsleep to extend the battery life.
    - all sensor nodes transmit on the same LoRa channel, but can have different addresses.
    - sensor node 01 has a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor ([code](examples/POC/SensorNodeE32_01.py))
    - sensor node 02 has a BMP180 temperature and pressure sensor ([code](examples/POC/SensorNodeE32_02.py))
    ![E32-868T20D](images/E32_sensor_node_01.jpg)

1. __Monitor node__ ([code](examples/POC/MonitorNodeE32.py))
    - this node contains an ESP32 microcontroller and an Ebyte E32 LoRa module. It is powered 24/7 with a 5V USB supply.
    - the E32 LoRa module is configured as a fixed monitor device (address 0xFFFF) and receives all transmissions from sensor node(s) with the same channel.
    - the incoming sensor data is stored in a Influxdb database table. The sensor data from each sensor node is stored in it's own database table.
    - the Influxdb database runs on a PC on the local network; the monitor node updates the database via a WiFi connection to the same local network.
